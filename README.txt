Description:
This app generates a quiz for the user to take in order to find out which plants are compatible for them and their
lifestyle to take care of, shows them their owned plants, and shows them the entire plant catalog if they are curious
about what plants they could potentially own, and they can mark plants as owned.

Usage:
Usage is self explanatory. When first running the program, you first see a menu page that welcomes you to the app and gives you options in the form of buttons. To take the quiz, press the "Take Quiz" button. To view the plant catalog, go to "Plant Catalog" where there is an option to mark plants as owned. To view the plants the user marks as owned, they will go to "Owned Plants". 

Instructions on Compiling Code:
No particularly unique instructions are required to run this app. It is self-explanatory at this point.

Bugs/Implementation Details/Etc:
No known bugs, though sometimes Android Studio can be a bit finicky with the databases. The way to fix this if needed is to go to Device File Explorer, data, databases, and then delete the databases and reload.
